# Network-Automation-using-Ansible
This idea of learning Ansible came to my mind when i was working on python scripting . I sincerely thank Kirk byers , David Bombal ,Csilla Bessenyei for their technical blogs and talks.
In this repository i will be adding my works on Network Automation using Ansible . I will be using Adhoc commands or Yaml scripts which are the most famous and reusable scripts .
About my lab set up :
1. I have used GNS3 2.0.3 ,GNS3 VM 
2. VIRL images for switches and routers
3. Ubuntu docker as Network Automation server 
4. Python 2.7.12 and Ansible 2.3.1.0
